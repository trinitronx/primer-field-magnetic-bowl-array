# Files for Rapid Prototyping of Magnetic Bowl Array

The files below allow you to produce a bowl-shaped magnetic array with Rapid Prototyping machines or through a [Rapid Prototyping Service][1].  The best file type to use for rapid prototyping is normally `.stl`. Here is a direct link to our file

These files can be sent to a Rapid Prototyping service to get an exact duplicate of the bowl-shaped array used in the PrimerCube. After producing these arrays with a 3D printer, we recommend using a reamer slightly larger than the magnets to ensure a snug fit. A reamer that is a maximum of .002‚Äù(.05  mm) larger than your magnets is ideal to prevent any tilting. Alternatively, you can calibrate your 3D printer to create holes of the correct dimensions without reaming. For calibration instructions, refer to the manual specific to your 3D printer model.

***IMPORTANT**

The stl files should be scaled according to the dimensions shown in the PDF file. Please specify this to the rapid prototyping service or set your 3d printer accordingly.  Once the magnets have been inserted according to the directions provided in the PrimerCube Manufacturing Guide, you will have a working array that is useful for pain relief in many situations. Although this array works for many pain issues even when not spinning, it is far more effective for pain and other ailments when spun at a speed of 3350 RPM as described in the PrimerCube Manufacturing Guide.

Also provided is the CNC code we used to drill the holes for the magnets in the pre-machined delrin bowls with our five axis mill. Machined delrin is desirable for spinning arrays, but rapid prototyping methods will work just fine for static (non-spinning) arrays.
